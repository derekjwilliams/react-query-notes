# Running

This is a super simple application. Both the mock server and client need to be run

## Mock Server

The json-server package is used to mock a server:

```npm run server```

The server runs on port 3001, so to see notes, use http://localhost:3001/notes

## Client

```npm run dev```

The client runs on port 5173, navigate to http://localhost:5173 to see the super simple client
